# Tk: initial value: number of starting points 


**************************************

Goal:
-----
Sample n points independently from f(x) by adaptive rejection sampling.

Steps:
-------
# D: The domain of the function f(x):
  
  If D is unbounded on the left, choose x1; unbounded on the right, choose x2.


# Calculate the functions U(x), S(x) and L(x) using equations given in the paper.


# Do sampling:

  sample a value x* from S(x);
  sample a value w independently from uniform(0,1) distribution.
  Perform squeezing test -> rejection test -> accept or reject x*

# Updating Tk:
  append x* into Tk, relabel elements of T(k+1) in ascending order. 

  Do the above calculation of U,S and L using new points.
